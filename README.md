## *At a Glance*

Broadly, I'm an interdisciplinary researcher with interests in psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, statistics, data science, and Japanese. More specifically, I work to apply statistical and data science methods to the problems in front of me. And if those problems relate to how we can leverage language to improve our lives and our understanding of the world, even better!

## *Projects*
### My larger projects, more immediately relevant to my research interests and past academic work:

- [particles](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/particles), contextual particle frequency in written Japanese, taking a swing at the age old question of は vs が
- [thesis](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/thesis), the scripts and analyses from my graduate thesis work, ["Investigating Emotion-label and Emotion-laden Words in a Semantic Satiation Paradigm"](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/10346/)
- [aozora_corpus](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/aozora_corpus), a compilation of Japanese texts pulled from 青空文庫, also available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ryancahildebrandt/aozora-bunko-japanese-text-corpus)
- [hanakotoba](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/hanakotoba), a project looking at the use of 花言葉 in literature 
- *Orthographic analysis of kanji and their radicals, on deck*
- *Automatic phoneme boundary detection (and annotation, why not?) in spoken Japanese, a bit of an aspirational project*

#### Some stats/NLP/dataviz side work I've done, partially of personal interest and partially to learn different data techniques:

- [yoji](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/yoji), applying neural networks to generate novel 四字熟語 idioms
- [ebook_tokenizer](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/ebook_tokenizer), a command to add spaces between Japanese words in eBooks to work with Kindle WordWise
- [kyoto](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/kyoto), an exploration of restaurants around train/subway stations in Kyoto
- [manyogana](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/manyogana), an application to translate Japanese text to a modern implementation of manyogana, as well as converting arabic numerals to kansuuji
- [movies](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/movies), a dataviz/exploration dashboard for the 10,000 movies dataset
- [michelin](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/michelin), exploration of Michelin star restaurants
- [tea_temps](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/tea_temps), a quick dataviz and reference for getting a good cup of tea
